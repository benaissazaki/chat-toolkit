# Chat toolkit (in progress)
Do cool things without leaving the chat window by binding hotkeys to certain actions.

## Available actions
- Send a random joke from JokeAPI
- Send a song's lyrics
- Send a song
- Send a message translated on the fly to any language
- Send an image

## Installation
Using pip:  
`pip install -r Pipfile`  

Using pipenv:  
`pipenv install`

## Usage
`python .`  or `pipenv start`

The program will start listening to your keyboard and do the actions corresponding to the pressed hotkey.

## Compatibility 
At the moment, some actions work only on windows.
